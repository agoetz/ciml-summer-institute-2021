## Parallel session: Machine Learning Overview (scheduled opposite Scientific Visualization with Visit) <a name="mach-learn"></a>

Participants who will be attending the Machine Learning Overview parallel session will need to install R (https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio Desktop open source edition (https://www.rstudio.com/) on their laptops. 

A basic understanding of R will be very helpful and we recommend the following resources:

* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf
* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html
