## Using GitHub<a name="github"></a>

Most of the training material will be located on the [CIML SI21 GitHub repo](https://github.com/ciml-org/ciml-summer-institute-2021). In addition, one of the Thursday hands-on sessions will require a GitHub account. If you do not already have one, you can create a free personal GitHub account [here] (https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).   
See this quick-start guide for using GitHub on SDSC resources: https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/basic_skills/tree/master/using_github

## Machine Learning  <a name="mach-learn"></a>

Participants who will be attending the Machine Learning Overview parallel session will need to install R (https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio Desktop open source edition (https://www.rstudio.com/) on their laptops. 

A basic understanding of R will be very helpful and we recommend the following resources:

* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf
* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html
