## Using GitHub<a name="github"></a>

Most of the training material will be located on the [CIML SI21 GitHub repo](https://github.com/ciml-org/ciml-summer-institute-2021). In addition, one of the Thursday hands-on sessions will require a GitHub account. If you do not already have one, you can create a free personal GitHub account [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).   
See this quick-start guide for using GitHub on SDSC resources: https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/basic_skills/tree/master/using_github

## Using Slack<a name="slack"></a>

We will also be using Slack as our main platform for announcements, where participants can communicate and ask for help. Download (Windows, MacOS, or Linux) and get started. Zoom chat will be disabled. Make sure to turn on your notifications to receive alerts.  
 
When setting up your “display name” on Zoom & Slack, please list your FIRST name, LAST name, and institution (i.e., Jane Doe (SDSC))

## Machine Learning  <a name="mach-learn"></a>

Participants who will be attending the Machine Learning Overview parallel session will need to install R (https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio Desktop open source edition (https://www.rstudio.com/) on their laptops. 

A basic understanding of R will be very helpful and we recommend the following resources:

* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf
* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html
