# Preparing for the CIML Summer Institute 2021
You will get the most out of the CIML Summer Institute if you are prepared prior to the event. By brushing up on your knowledge of Linux and installing all necessary software on your laptop before to the event, you’ll be able to focus your attention on the skills and topics that are most relevant to high performance and data intensive computing.
