# Preparing for the CIML Summer Institute 2021
You will get the most out of the CIML Summer Institute if you are prepared prior to the event. By brushing up on your knowledge of Linux and installing all necessary software on your laptop before to the event, you’ll be able to focus your attention on the skills and topics that are most relevant to high performance and data intensive computing.

To help you get the most out of this workshop, this section contains a set of detailed start-up instructions, beginning with setting up your account and connecting to Expanse, to configuring your laptop for running visualization software. Please read the documents and exercises carefully, and complete all necessary steps before event. Feel free to ask questions or if you have any problems with the start-up tasks

* You will be given an account on the SDSC Expanse computer. Information on the account will be sent to you via email. Please complete the process of activating your account before the institute begins.

### Logging onto the Expanse Portal: <a name="logon-portal"></a>
* This section will be covered on day 1 (1.3 Expanse & Expanse User Portal).

 ## Computer and Laptop Set-up: <a name="computer-req"></a>
* We recommend a second screen for the hands-on sessions. The first to view the presentation, the second for hands-on.
* After you access your account information, confirm that you can login (SSH) to Expanse using the device you plan to use during the CIML Summer Institute (laptop, workstation, etc...).  Detailed instructions on connecting to Expanse using SSH can be found [here](https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/basic_skills/tree/master/connecting-to-hpc-systems).  

It has been suggested that a second monitor may be helpful during online instruction.  While one monitor could be used to follow instruction, the other for the hands-on.  Additionally, the use of a mouse may be beneficial as well during some sessions.
