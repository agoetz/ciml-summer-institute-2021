## Exercise: MNIST with noise, adding L1 regularization, and using tensorboard 

A short exercise to practice adding options to layers, and using tensorboard

**MNIST is too easy, so switch labels to make learning harder**

**Try an L1 regularization  (L1 penalty) on the classification layer**
(look for the   “ <<<<<< -------  “       in the comments)

**View results in tensorboard.dev  (you will need a google id)**
